      <description>About Us Safe Cardano is ran by IT professionals with over two decades of experience in designing and implementing enterprise solutions for a range of organisations. We are experts in building and operating secure, high available and reliable distributed Linux Systems.
We are also experienced stake pool operators, operating different stake pool services from the very start of the Cardano Incentivised Testnet (ITN).
There are many lessons we have learnt throughout the ITN journey, these learnings have now shaped our current stake pool solution to ensure we continue to provide the best possible safe and most reliable service back to our delegators.</description>
